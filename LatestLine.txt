Implicit Wait - Implicit waits are used to provide a default waiting time (say 30 seconds) between each consecutive test step/command across the entire test script. Implicitly wait is applied globally, which means it is always available for all the web elements throughout the driver instance. It implies that if the driver is interacting with 100 elements, then implicitly wait is applicable for all the 100 elements.
